# Klipper-E3V2 Configuration
Configuration files for my Ender 3 V2 Klipper setup. The MACROS could be used for general guidelines across any Klipper setup.
# Careful with the printer.cfg This is for my specific setup. 
### Find generic Ender 3 V2 printer.cfg elsewhere.
Do not blindly copy and paste the printer.cfg. 
My Ender 3 V2 is barely an Ender 3 V2. I have an all metal hotend, direct drive, belted z, upgraded bed heater, and so on.
Many configurations such could destroy your printer if you are unsure of their meaning.
For example, "max_temp: 300" in the extruder is set as I have an all metal hotend. This will destroy a stock E3V2 hotend, or any
PTFE lined hotend.
# What could be general guides
The macros.
